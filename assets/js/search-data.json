Most of the time, these can be removed by a modder. | Bushing tune: Some makers and enthusiast owners are poor/lazy tuners. You may ask the seller to crank on the screws to get an assessment. But because of variability with hand cranking, your seller may not able to confirm if their balisong is truly binding. How bouncy a balisong is may help determine if a has undersized bushings; if they seem flat and weak in a video, they are probably undersized. Bushings can be bought from TrueLink or USAKnifemaker. | Tolerances: Most sellers will not be able to ascertain how well surfaced the blade or handles are (unless they have calipers/micrometers), usually you can infer by who made it and during what time period. | .

Makers and modders make for good middlemans, be wary of individual reputation though. If a package has gone missing, it is upright for the seller to compensate you; but, do not count on them doing so. A reasonable ask is to go 50/50 on the cost of the item. Scammers . Sometimes you‚Äôll run across sellers that seem shady and have little references. Here‚Äôs a few things you can do to protect yourself. | Request a video with a timestamp and username in view to check if they actually own the item. | Ask for names of previous buyers to verify their selling history. | Discuss relevant and current topics on balisongs; scammers tend to be unknowledgable on the hobby. | Opt to use PayPal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) to have leverage during scammer confrontation. | . Trading . In the case of trading, it is inherently riskier than buying since there are no feasible recourses to recoup lost value. It is highly advised to get a middleman to facilitate the trade. Without a middleman, you would ship at the same time as the other person. Sometimes you can recall a package if the trader seems to be delaying shipment. ",

    "content": ". To stop the handles from directly rubbing against the blade when constructed, a pivot system is required. Visit the lubricant page for a list of lubricants to use for your pivot system. Washers only . Washers are thin, circular, small pieces of metal with a hole that sits between the handles and blade, going around the sexbolt. The typical and safe material to use is phosphorous bronze (PB) washers. Be careful with these metal washers: . | Titanium washers: Wear-and-tear will fuse the washers and into titanium handles. | Steel washers: Steel washers do hold their tune much longer than PB washers, but under-lubrication causes the washers to eat into the blade. | . Tuning . Tuning a washers-only balisong is simple. | Apply thread locking. | Crank the screws right before the balisong motion seizes. | . One side of the washer typically has smoothed edges and a smoother surface; that side should be facing the washers. If one side is not smoother, the side does not matter, but be consistent. Bearings . ‚Ä¶ . Bushings . Bushings are metal cylinders that sit within the blade pivot blades and are sandwich between the washers then the handles. Bushings minimize damage to the handles and blade by acting as a intermediate between the washer and the blade. The bushing itself maintains tolerances for a long ass time, you don‚Äôt need to swap these out unless the initial tune is bad. The only thing you need to do is . | lubricate the pivots | swap out the washers when tolerances are not satisfactory | . Tuning . Your bushings are considered undersized if a full crank of your screws causes the motion of your balisong to seize, to any degree. To fix this, you need to tune a new set of bushings with the correct thickness. You are better off sending it back to the maker for a retune if tolerances are not up to standard; most makers will charge you for a bushing retune if you tamper with the bushings. Undersized bushings are considered a manufacturering defect; most will retune free-of-charge. To tune your bushings, you need . | a flat surface | some sandpaper | . | Lay some sandpaper onto the flat surface. | Pick one side of the bushing to work on. Be consistent. | Lay the bushing onto the sandpaper and move in a circle to remove material. Do not press down hard; if you hand or bushing is slipping off the sandpaper, press softer. | Constantly check if you have removed too much material by reconstructing your balisong. For the final check, use fresh washers. | . This a barebone description of how you can tune bushings. If you want consistent and accurate bushing tunes, get . | several sheets of sandpaper at different grit levels (e.g., 200, 500, and 1000); as you get closer to blade thickness, increase the grit level for some breathing room | a measurement tool (e.g., micrometer) to dial in the exact thickness | a bushing lap or bushing buddy to sand your bushings parallel to your flat surface and perpendicular (thickness length is at a right angle to the width of circle) | .

    "title": "Stop System",
    "content": ". Your stop system prevents the handles and blade from slapping into each other; typically small, metal dowels are put into either the blade or handles to accomplish this. Zen pins . When the stop pins lie in the handles, that is a zen pin system. The HRC of the zen pins should match with the blade‚Äôs so they last long. There are 3 variants of them: . | Pressed: When the pins are pressed into the handles with tooling. Requires an extra set of zen pins to replace and an arbor press. You will most likely pay the maker to replace the pins. | Screwed: When the pins are screws that go into one/two-sided sexbolts (possibly with a lip). Will require threadlocking to stay in place. | Hidden: When the top of the pins are hidden from the top of the handles, easily by sandwich/chandwich construction or cleverly alongside channel construction (link Zentinel). These are the easiest to service as they only require screw-less hardware. | . Tang pins . When the stop pins lie in the blade, that is a tang pin system. This system outperforms zen pins on longevity (on a single charge) when the pins match the HRC of the handles; soft-on-soft interaction wears down the least material compared to hard-on-hard interaction. Two variants exist for tang pins: . | Pressed: When the pins are pressed into the blade. You must have pins and an arbor press. Typically, you will pay the maker to replace them. | Screwed: The least desired variant, when the tang pins are screwed in place. Threadlocking is required. You must buy these from the maker. | . Pinless . When the handles and blade are designed to contact on the blade tang without pins, it is called a pinless system. There is typically no intermediate-part maintenance, but be wary as the blade contacting the handles will wear them down by the mismatch of HRC. You must replace either the handles or blade when the blade and handles start to slap. There are some pinless designs that replace the contact point on the handles with a replacable part. By construction, it is still pinless as the part is not a pin, but it detracts from the hardware-less essence of a pinless design, as an intermediate part exists now, a proprietary part even harder to replace than a simple metal pin.

    "content": ". This BladeHQ interactive page provides a good breakdown of different properties of steel. We won‚Äôt reiterate on knowledge from better sources, so we focus on what is important for a balisong. Blade material largely does not matter for flipping, but will matter when beating. The main distinction to watch for is, carbon steel, semi-stainless steel, and stainless steel. Carbon steel needs to be oiled to prevent oxidation for their higher carbon content. Stainless steel does not require blade oiling under normal usage. Semi-stainless steel sits in the middle; for less humid climates, blade oiling may not be needed. A majority of modern balisongs are stainless steel; a few are commonly used for balisongs: . | AEB-L/440C, 154CM, CPM-154, S35VN | . Exotic Material . Damascus . Damascus is considered a laminate of two or more steels that is manipulated to produce a pattern during the fabrication process. As with regular steel, they come in carbon steel or stainless steel. | Nichols Damascus | Vegas Forge | Damasteel | Alpha Knife Supply | Bulldog Damascus Billets | Bertie Rietveld | Mike Norris Damascus | . San Mai . Some steels are made by a san mai process, a combining of two steels where one steel is the outer steel and another is the inner steel; this process forms a lamination line (where the two steels meet) in the grind when the blade is ground. The outer steel is called the jacket while the inner steel is called the core. Most damascus makers also make cored steel as well; some even combine both the san mai and damascus process by setting the simple steel as the core while the damascsus steel as the jacket. | Core Damascus (Nichols Damascus) | San Mai (Vegas Forge) | Damacore (Damasteel) | CopperMai (Baker Forge &amp; Tool): Inclusion of copper into the damascus or the lamination line. | .

Typically used as scale material as well. | Aluminum: Very lightweight metal commonly used on cheaper balisongs.

They offers 3 main types of shipping. | Ground Advantage (formerly known as first class) | Priority | Priority Express | . From least expensive to most expensive, they increase by shipping speed; in practice, ground advantage is usually equal speed in priority. They are all equally reliable in safety, Express being slighty better because of guaranteed 1 or 2 day fulfillment. Third-party shipping websites like Pirateship can offer lower costs on shipping. Pirateship in particular can greatly cut the cost of more expensive shipping services like Priority Express from USPS or Next Day Air from UPS. It is good practice to drop off a package at the front desk or at the internal bin in the post office. If you choose to use an outside dropoff location, you take on the risk of the item being stolen. FedEx and UPS are also acceptable options if USPS near you is not reliable. Packaging . For a box or envelope, at minimum you must tape any loose edges. Use the soft, flexible envelopes, not the paper ones; you must also roll it up. If you pack poorly, it is 100% your fault and you must recompensate the buyer. If you can‚Äôt find packing material like bubble wrap, paper towels work well. You should be stuffing just enough so that the item does not slide around in the box or envelope. Insurance . If you use USPS, do not get the insurance they offer; the price of insurance is marked on the package and has lead to theft by USPS workers in the past. Shipsurance from Pirateship works well and hides the price from the shipping company. If you are the first time owner and have a receipt, you will be much more successful when claiming the insurance.
