# Why are balisongs expensive?
---

- **Hobby**: Balisong flipping is quite a niche hobby. Due to this, there are not very many companies making them, and those who do tend to use batch production. This means that they cannot take advantage of the cost savings from mass production as they would likely end up with stock they cannot sell.
- **Costs**: A lot of work goes into making one. When thinking of production costs, people generally like to only think of material cost and say things like “it's only 3 pieces of metal”. This is far from the only cost involved: rent, utilities, wages, insurance and machine costs (the average cost of a CNC is $75,000) are all factors that go into the end cost of a balisong.
- **Design**: Making an original design is time consuming and requires a certain skill set, especially to get it to flip well. Companies can spend months, even years getting a balisong to look good and flip well.
- **Quality and Tolerances**: Balisongs have to have extremely tight tolerances to avoid what is known as tap (⁠Terminology). Maintaining  these tolerances while still outputting enough to maintain market demand is extremely labour intensive, not to mention the cost involved in a good quality control procedure.
- **Materials**: Most balisongs are made with 6061 aluminum, which is a quite simple material to work with. However, higher end balisongs are made with 7075 or titanium, which are much harder to work with, and require more expensive tooling to mill.


Here are a couple of videos that go through the manufacturing and assembly process of Squid Industries (bearing in mind they're one of the largest companies with one of, if not the highest output):
