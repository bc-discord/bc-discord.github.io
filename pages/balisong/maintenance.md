# Maintenance
Two main parts on the balisong wear down: the stop system and pivot system, assuming you don't beat your balisong.

## Pivot System
---
Visit the [lubricant]({% link pages/balisong/lubricants.md %}) page for a list of lubricants to use for your pivot system.

### Washers only

Washers are thin, circular, small pieces of metal with a hole that sits between the handles and blade, going around the sexbolt. The typical and safe material to use is phosphorous bronze (PB) washers.

**Be careful** with these metal washers:

- Titanium washers: Wear-and-tear will fuse the washers and into the handles.
- Steel washers: Under-lubrication causes the washers to eat into the blade. But steel washers do hold their tune much longer than PB washers.

#### Tuning
Tuning a washers-only balisong is simple.

1. Apply thread locking.
2. Crank the screws right before the balisong motion seizes. 

### Bearings

### Bushings

<ins>Bushings</ins> are metal cylinders that sit within the blade pivot blades and are sandwich between the washers then the handles. Bushings minimize damage to the handles and blade by acting as a intermediate between the washer and the blade. They are typically made of steel.

The bushing itself maintains tolerances for a long ass time, you don't need to swap these out unless the initial tune is bad. The only thing you need to do is 
- lubricate the pivots
- swap out the washers when tolerances are not satisfactory

#### Tuning
Your bushings are considered <ins>undersized</ins> if a full crank of your screws causes the motion of your balisong to seize, to any degree. To fix this, you need to tune a new set of bushings that over thicker than your blade thickness. 

{: .important }
> You are better off sending it back to the maker for a retune if tolerances are not up to standard. Undersized bushings are considered a manufacturering defect; most manufacturers will charge you for a bushing retune if you tamper with the bushings.

To tune your bushings, you need 
- a flat surface
- some sandpaper

1. Lay some sandpaper onto the flat surface.
2. Pick one side of the bushing to work on. **Be consistent**.
3. Lay the bushing onto the sandpaper. Do not press down hard. 
4. Move the bushing slowly in a circle on the sandpaper to remove material.
5. Constantly check if you have removed too much material by reconstructing your balisong.

This a barebone description of how you can tune bushings. Get a measurement tool (e.g., micrometer) and bushing puck if you want consistent and accurate bushing tunes.

## Stop System
---
### Zen pins
When the stop pins lie in the handles, that is a <ins>zen pin</ins> system. The HRC of the zen pins should match with the blade's so they last long. There are 3 variants of them:
- Pressed: When the pins are <ins>pressed</ins> into the handles with tooling. Requires an extra set of zen pins to replace. You will most likely request the manufacturer to replace the pins when the handles and blade start to slap.
- Screwed: When the pins are <ins>screws</ins> that go into one/two-sided sexbolts, possibly with a lip. Will require [threadlocking]({% link pages/balisong/threadlocking.md %}) to stay in place.
- Hidden: When the top of the pins are <ins>hidden</ins> from the top of the handles, easily by sandwich/chandwich construction or cleverly using channel construction (link Zentinel). These are the easiest to service as they only require screw-less hardware.

### Tang pins

When the stop pins lie in the blade, that is a <ins>tang pin</ins> system. This system outperforms zen pins on longevity (of a single charge) when the pins match the HRC of the handles; soft-on-soft interaction wears down the least material compared to hard-on-hard (gigiddy) interaction. Two varaints exist for tang pins:

- Pressed: When the pins are <ins>pressed</ins> into the blade. You must have pins and an arbor press. Typically, you will pay the manufacturer to replace them.
- Screwed: The most annoying varaint, when the tang pins are <ins>screwed</ins> in place. [Threadlocking]({% link pages/balisong/threadlocking.md %}) is required. Buy many backups.

### Pinless
When the handles and blade are designed in such a way that their contact points align, that is called a <ins>pinless</ins> system. There is no intermediate-part maintenance, but be wary as the blade contacting the handles will wear them down if the materials do not match HRC. You must replace either the handles or blade, there are no cheap intermediate parts to replace; typically blade replacements are done.

There are some pinsless designs (link Fiori design) replace the contact point of the handles with a stronger material to handle the force of the blade. One can argue it is no longer pinless as the 'pin' is designed into the handles.
