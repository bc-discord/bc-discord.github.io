# Materials
## Handles
---
 For modern balisongs, a few materials are used for balisong handles:
 - **Titanium**: The most used grade is 6Al-4V (grade 5). 
 - **Aluminum**: Either 6061 or 7075; makes no difference in flipping unless heavily beaten to show difference between durability.
 - **Carbon Fiber**: Typically used as scale materials.
 - **G-10**: Typically used as scale materials.
 - **Micarta**: Typically used as scale materials.

### Fancy Material

#### Titanium ONLY

- Timascus (trademark by Alpha Knife Supply)
- MokuTi
- Damatanium (trademark by VegasForge)
- Crystalized Titanium

#### Titanium + Zirconium

- **Zircuti**: A damascus style material made by layering titanium and zirconium, then heat treated to create colors and patterns

#### Mokume

- **Mokume-Gane**: A damascus style material made by layering nonreactive materials, typically nickel, silver, copper, and brass.

## Blade
---

This [BladeHQ interactive page](https://www.bladehq.com/blog/knife-steel-guide) provides a good breakdown of different properties of steel. We won't reiterate on knowledge from better sources, so we focus on what is important for a balisong.

Blade material largely does not matter for flipping, but will matter when beating. The main distinction to watch for is, **carbon steel**, **semi-stainless steel**, and **stainless steel**. Carbon steel needs to be oiled to prevent oxidation for their higher carbon content. Stainless steel does not require blade oiling under normal usage. Semi-stainless steel sits in the middle; for less humid climates, blade oiling may not be needed.

A majority of modern balisongs are stainless steel; a few are commonly used for balisongs:
- AEB-L/440C, 154CM, CPM-154, S35VN

### Fancy Material

**Damascus** is considered a laminate of two or more steels that is manipulated to produce a pattern during the fabrication process. As with regular steel, they come in carbon steel or stainless steel.

Few makers have experience with machining this material:
- Stitched Steel, Sycoblade Works, Mantis Bladeworks, Squid Industries, Eldon Talley

Some steels have a **core**, meaning two steels are sandwich together; one steel being the 'bread', another steel being the 'meat'. Most damascus makers also make cored steel as well. Damascus makers can even combine both, meaning damascus steel for the 'bread' then a simpler steel for the 'meat'.
