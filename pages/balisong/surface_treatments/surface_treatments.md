# Surface Treatments

If you want to find modders that can execute these finishes for your balisong parts, check the [Modders page]({% link pages/catalogs/modders.md %}).

## Finishes
---
A <ins>finish</ins> is a particular styling of the surface of a metal by removing miniscule amounts of material.

- Satin: Shiny finish that is the commonly seen on Aluminum and Titanium. Achieved by low grit abrasives. Can be slippery when using low enough grit.
- Polished: An even shiner finish, even reflective when the surface is a high enough grit. Achieved by progressively using higher and higher grit abrasives. Can be very grippy if using a high enough grit (think of running your finger along a mirror).
- Stonewashing: Tumbling of parts and abrasive media to make a matte finish. Level of matte grip is determined by the media and duration of tumbling.
- Blasting: A process of shooting highly-pressurized media at a metal part to texturize the surface. Degree of roughness depends on the media used. 
    - Examples: beadblasting, sandblasting, glassblasting, zirblasting (zirconia media)
- Orange peel: 

### Steel
- Blueing: Blue coloring of carbon steel with nitride salts.

### Titanium
- Frost: On lower grade Titanium, etching can cause a crystal-like pattern to appear. Not possible to achieve from the usual 6Al-4V Titanium used by balisong makers.
- Crystal: A pattern that comes from heating Titanium in a vacuum to produce a crystal look; much stronger than a frost. For it's difficulty to produce, a few [Titanium damascus]({% link pages/balisong/materials.md %}#titanium-only) makers sell billets of them.

## Coatings
---
A <ins>coating</ins> is an encompassing material that is imparted onto the surface of the metal.

- DLC (diamond-like carbon): Completely black coating applied to both handle and blade material. The most common way to get a shiny finish and a black coating for balisongs. Retains the underlying texture of the material.
    - Not possible for an individual to perform. Only a handful of companies provide this process; they only take batches. You can find people that pool together individual orders to make the submission to the company worthwhile.
- PVD (physical vapor deposition):
- Cerakote:
    - Can be reasonably applied by individuals (i.e., modders).
- Blackening: A repeated process of an oil quenching and application of high heat, started by an initial blast. By touch, has a rough rubber feel; very grippy.
    - Main barrier to entry for this coating is having a forge. Few modders are capable.

## Anodization
---
An <ins>anodization</ins> is an electrochemical process that uses electricity in an electrolyte bath to grow an oxide layer on a metal surface to color the part.

- Aluminum: A coloring of Al by opening up the oxide layer and dying the layer with pigment.
    - Not feasible for an individual to do; it is a very **hazardous** process. Incredibly few individuals have attempted this process. 
- Titanium: A thin oxide layer that reflects a wide range of pretty colors; the thickness of the oxide layer dictating the color reflected.
    - Accomplished easily with cheap materials by any modder.
