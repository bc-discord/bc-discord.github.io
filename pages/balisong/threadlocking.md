# Threadlocking
To fasten the screw to a sexbolt, you need a <ins>threadlocker</ins>.

## Liquid
---

Liquid-based threadlocking that works on screws. The liquid fills in the gaps of the screws and sexbolt to form a seal after curing. Loctite is the common product (from Henkel) most people are familiar with and sometimes used in general to refer to liquid-based threadlocking. Some metals and coatings require a primer to aid the curing process. 

### Hankel

| Loctite | Link | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Blue 242 | [Loctite](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-243/BP000000316211.html) | The most commonly used. Breaks easily by hand; will come undone often if you vibriate your balisong often. |
|Blue 243 | [Loctite](https://www.loctiteproducts.com/products/central-pdp.html/loctite-threadlocker-blue/SAP_0201OHL029W4.html) | You bought the wrong one. **Needs a primer.** |
| Red 262 | [Loctite](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-263/BP000000347828.html) | High strength loctite. Most likely can't break away by hand, unless a minimal amount was applied. Requires threadlocker to be **heated** to unscrew; boiling your pivots for a minute suffices. |
| Red 263 | [Loctite](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-262/BP000000153483.html) | Same as Red 262 but without a primer. This loctite may be strong enough without a primer. |

### Vibra-Tite
A company that sells primarily locking and sealing products.

## Solid
---
These methods use solid objects to keep the screw and sexbolt secure. Be warned, you are jamming your threads and incurring some damage to your hardware. Use these methods infrequently as you can.

### Teflon tape
Also called plumbers tape. 

Instructions: Wind the tape along the screws of the balisong, wrapping in the direction that screws turn so the tape doesn't unwind when screwing in.

### Paracord
