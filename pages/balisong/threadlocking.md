# Threadlocking
## Liquid
---

Liquid-based threadlocking that works on screws. The liquid fills in the gaps of the screws and sexbolt to form a seal after curing. Loctite is the common product (from Henkel) most people are familiar with and sometimes used in general to refer to liquid-based threadlocking. Some metals and coatings require a primer to aid the curing process. 

### Loctite
Product line made by Henkel. [Loctite SF 770](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-sf-770/BP000000153555.html) is their recommended primer.

| Loctite | Link | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Blue 242 | [Loctite](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-243/BP000000316211.html) | The most commonly used. Breaks easily by hand; will come undone often if you vibriate your balisong often. |
|Blue 243 | [Loctite](https://www.loctiteproducts.com/products/central-pdp.html/loctite-threadlocker-blue/SAP_0201OHL029W4.html) | You bought the wrong one. **Needs a primer.** |
| Red 262 | [Loctite](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-263/BP000000347828.html) | High strength loctite. Most likely can't break away by hand, unless a minimal amount was applie. Requires an applied **heat** to unscrew; boiling your pivots for a minute does the trick. |
| Red 263 | [Loctite](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-262/BP000000153483.html) | Same as Red 262 but without a primer. This may still work, even without a primer. |

## Physical
---
These methods use physical objects to keep the screw and sexbolt secure. Be warned, you are jamming your threads and incur damage to your hardware. Do this as least often as you can.

### Teflon tape
Also called plumbers tape. 

Instructions: Wind the tape along the screws of the balisong, wraping in the direction that screws turn so the tape doesn't unwind when screwing in.

### Paracord
