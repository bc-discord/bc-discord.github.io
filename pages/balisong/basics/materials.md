## Basic

### Blade

This [Blade HQ interactive page](https://www.bladehq.com/blog/knife-steel-guide) provides a good breakdown of different properties of steel. We won't reiterate on knowledge from better sources, so we focus on what is important for a balisong.

Blade material largely does not matter for flipping, but will matter when beating. The main distinction to watch for is, carbon steel, semi-stainless steel, and stainless steel. <ins>Carbon steel</ins> needs to be oiled to prevent oxidation for their higher carbon content. <ins>Stainless steel</ins> does not require blade oiling under normal usage. <ins>Semi-stainless steel</ins> sits in the middle; for less humid climates, blade oiling may not be needed.

A majority of modern balisongs are stainless steel; a few are commonly used for balisongs:
- AEB-L/440C, 154CM, CPM-154, S35VN

### Handles
 For modern balisongs, a few materials are used for balisong handles:
 - Carbon Fiber: A composite laminate where fibers and resin are layered. This case, the fiber being carbon strands. Typically used as scale material.
 - G-10: Another composite laminate, but the fiber is glass. Typically used as scale material as well.
 - Aluminum: Very lightweight metal commonly used on cheaper balisongs. Two most common grades are 6061 or 7075; the lighter is 6061, while being weaker than 7075.
 - Titanium: The most commonly used metal for high-end balisongs. Lightweight for it's given structural properties. The most used grade is 6Al-4V (grade 5) while the chinese competitor is TC4. More expensive than Aluminum and harder to machine because of the 'spongey' properties of Titanium compared to other metals.

## Exotic

Exotic materials are expensive materials that are rare and/or expensive. Many of these exotic materials have 'layered' look to them, inspired by damascus steel.

### Blade

#### Damascus
<ins>Damascus</ins> is considered a laminate of two or more steels that is manipulated to produce a pattern during the fabrication process. As with regular steel, they come in carbon steel or stainless steel.

#### San Mai
Some steels are made by a <ins>san mai</ins> process, a combining of two steels where one steel is the outer steel and another is the inner steel; this process forms a <ins>lamination line</ins> (where the two steels meet) in the grind when the blade is ground. The outer steel is called the <ins>jacket</ins> while the inner steel is called the <ins>core</ins>. Most damascus makers also make cored steel as well; some even combine both the san mai and damascus process by setting the simple steel as the core while the damascsus steel as the jacket.

### Handle

#### Carbon Fiber
Layering of several colors of carbon fiber, similar layered look to damascus.
