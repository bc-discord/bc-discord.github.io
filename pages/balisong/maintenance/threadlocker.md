# Threadlocker
To fasten the screw to a sexbolt, you need a <ins>threadlocker</ins>.

---

## Liquid

Liquid-based threadlocking that works on screws. The liquid fills in the gaps of the screws and sexbolt to form a seal after curing. Loctite is the common product (from Henkel) most people are familiar with and sometimes used in general to refer to liquid-based threadlocking. Some metals and coatings require a primer to aid the curing process. 

This is the **recommended** medium for threadlocking. Solid-based solutions jam your threads, incurring damage. 

### Henkel
Henkel makes their Loctite product line for metal fasteners. [Loctite SF 770](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-sf-770/BP000000153555.html) is their recommended primer.

> Pay attention to the number.

| Loctite | Link | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Blue 242 | [Loctite](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-243/BP000000316211.html) | The most commonly used. Breaks easily by hand; will come undone often if you vibriate your balisong often. |
|Blue 243 | [Loctite](https://www.loctiteproducts.com/products/central-pdp.html/loctite-threadlocker-blue/SAP_0201OHL029W4.html) | You bought the wrong one. **Needs a primer.** |
| Red 262 | [Loctite](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-263/BP000000347828.html) | High strength loctite. Most likely can't break away by hand, unless a minimal amount was applied. Requires threadlocker to be **heated** to unscrew; boiling your pivots for a minute suffices. |
| Red 263 | [Loctite](https://next.henkel-adhesives.com/us/en/products/industrial-adhesives/central-pdp.html/loctite-262/BP000000153483.html) | Same as Red 262 but without a primer. This loctite may be strong enough without a primer. |

### Vibra-Tite
A company that sells primarily locking and sealing products.

## Solid

These methods use solid objects to keep the screw and sexbolt secure. **Be warned**, you are jamming your threads and incurring some damage to your hardware. Use these methods infrequently as you can.

### Teflon tape
Also called plumbers tape. 

Instructions: 
1. Wrap your tape around your screw a few times, winding along the same rotation your screws go in, so that the tape doesn't unwind when screwing in.
2. Cut off your tape from the container and remove the excess from the bottom of your screw (your tape width won't be longer than your screw).
3. Now screw your screw into the sexbolt. If you see excess coming out around the screw, you used too much.

### Paracord

Instructions: 
1. Cut open your paracord and take out a string.
2. Wrap your paracord around your screw, starting at the bottom third.
3. Screw in your screw into the sexbolt.
4. Cut/burn off the excess.

## Hardware

Alternative to using a fastener, you may opt to replace your hardware with fine-pitch hardware. The typical threading for screws and sexbolts is 6-32, but you may find 6-64 from several [hardware sellers]({{ 'maintenance.html' | relative_link }}#hardware). The denser threading yield a better clamping force, fastening your hardware better. Additionally, you will find that a looser tune becomes a tighter tune (degree varies); the tune may become too tight, and a retune is required.

1. Find fine-pitch hardware with the same diameter and close enough length. You can potentially buy hardware at a longer/shorter length, but 
    - the screws must be long enough
    - the sexbolts ends must not reach the counterbore for the screw, otherwise your balisong pivot system won't clamp down together
2. Replace pivot system with fine-pitch hardware.
2. [Retune your bushings]({{ 'pivot_system/pivot_system.html' | relative_link }}#tuning-1) if your balisong is binding.
