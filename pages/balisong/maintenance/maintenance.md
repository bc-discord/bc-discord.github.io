# Maintenance
Two main parts on the balisong wear down: the stop system and pivot system, assuming you don't beat your balisong.

## Hardware
---
There are quite a few places to get hardware:

| Name / Link | Description | Unique Sells |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| [TRUE~LINK](https://thetruelink.com/) | Satisfies most of your hardware needs. | Spacer barrels, PVD (black, gold) screws and pivots, designer screws |
| [USA Knife Maker](https://usaknifemaker.com/) | Another good place to find hardware. | Bushing lap |
| [Alpha Knife Supply](https://www.alphaknifesupply.com/shop/knife-making-hardware) | Less used hardware shop for balisongs. | - |
| [Squid Industries](https://www.squidindustries.co/collections/hardware) | Provides hardware for all Squid Industry balisongs. | Anodized titanium hardware, flat head hardware |
| [MachineWise](https://machinewise.store/products/hardware-kit) | Provides hardware for all modern MachineWise balisongs. | - |
| [JK Designs](https://jkdesign.us/collections/hardware) | Provides hardware for all his design and produced balisongs. Most likely works for his outsourced production work as well. | Deltoid pivots |

Most hardware you find has the Replicant-style pivot specifications.

## Pivot System
---
To stop the handles from directly rubbing against the blade when constructed, a <ins>pivot system</ins> is required. Visit the [lubricant]({% link pages/balisong/maintenance/lubricants.md %}) page for a list of lubricants to use for your pivot system.

### Washers only

Washers are thin, circular, small pieces of metal with a hole that sits between the handles and blade, going around the sexbolt. The typical and safe material to use is phosphorous bronze (PB) washers.

**Be careful** with these metal washers:

- Titanium washers: Wear-and-tear will fuse the washers and into titanium handles.
- Steel washers: Steel washers do hold their tune much longer than PB washers, but under-lubrication causes the washers to eat into the blade.

#### Tuning
Tuning a washers-only balisong is simple.

1. Apply thread locking.
2. Crank the screws right before the balisong motion seizes. 

{: .important }
> One side of the washer typically has smoothed edges and a smoother surface; that side should be facing the washers. If one side is not smoother, the side does not matter, but be consistent.

### Bearings
...

### Bushings

<ins>Bushings</ins> are metal cylinders that sit within the blade pivot blades and are sandwich between the washers then the handles. Bushings minimize damage to the handles and blade by acting as a intermediate between the washer and the blade.

The bushing itself maintains tolerances for a long ass time, you don't need to swap these out unless the initial tune is bad. The only thing you need to do is
- lubricate the pivots
- swap out the washers when tolerances are not satisfactory

#### Tuning
Your bushings are considered <ins>undersized</ins> if a full crank of your screws causes the motion of your balisong to seize, to any degree. To fix this, you need to tune a new set of bushings with the correct thickness. 

{: .important }
> You are better off sending it back to the maker for a retune if tolerances are not up to standard; most makers will charge you for a bushing retune if you tamper with the bushings. Undersized bushings are considered a manufacturering defect; most will retune free-of-charge.

To tune your bushings, you need 
- a flat surface
- some sandpaper

1. Lay some sandpaper onto the flat surface.
2. Pick one side of the bushing to work on. **Be consistent**.
3. Lay the bushing onto the sandpaper and move in a circle to remove material. **Do not press down hard**; if you hand or bushing is slipping off the sandpaper, press softer.
4. Constantly check if you have removed too much material by reconstructing your balisong. For the final check, use fresh washers.

This a barebone description of how you can tune bushings. If you want consistent and accurate bushing tunes, get 
- several sheets of sandpaper at different grit levels (e.g., 200, 500, and 1000); as you get closer to blade thickness, increase the grit level for some breathing room
- a measurement tool (e.g., micrometer) to dial in the exact thickness
- a [bushing lap](https://usaknifemaker.com/pivot-lap-basic-knifedogs-5-bushing-model.html) or [bushing buddy](https://www.squidindustries.co/products/bushing-buddy) to sand your bushings parallel to your flat surface and perpendicular (thickness length is at a right angle to the width of circle)

## Stop System
---
Your <ins>stop system</ins> prevents the handles and blade from slapping into each other; typically small, metal dowels are put into either the blade or handles to accomplish this.

### Zen pins
When the stop pins lie in the handles, that is a <ins>zen pin</ins> system. The HRC of the zen pins should match with the blade's so they last long. There are 3 variants of them:
- Pressed: When the pins are <ins>pressed</ins> into the handles with tooling. Requires an extra set of zen pins to replace and an arbor press. You will most likely pay the maker to replace the pins.
- Screwed: When the pins are <ins>screws</ins> that go into one/two-sided sexbolts (possibly with a lip). Will require [threadlocking]({% link pages/balisong/maintenance/threadlocker.md %}) to stay in place.
- Hidden: When the top of the pins are <ins>hidden</ins> from the top of the handles, easily by sandwich/chandwich construction or cleverly alongside channel construction (link Zentinel). These are the easiest to service as they only require screw-less hardware.

### Tang pins

When the stop pins lie in the blade, that is a <ins>tang pin</ins> system. This system outperforms zen pins on longevity (on a single charge) when the pins match the HRC of the handles; soft-on-soft interaction wears down the least material compared to hard-on-hard interaction. Two variants exist for tang pins:

- Pressed: When the pins are <ins>pressed</ins> into the blade. You must have pins and an arbor press. Typically, you will pay the maker to replace them.
- Screwed: The least desired variant, when the tang pins are <ins>screwed</ins> in place. [Threadlocking]({% link pages/balisong/maintenance/threadlocker.md %}) is required. You must buy these from the maker.

### Pinless
When the handles and blade are designed to contact on the blade tang without pins, it is called a <ins>pinless</ins> system. There is typically no intermediate-part maintenance, but be wary as the blade contacting the handles will wear them down by the mismatch of HRC. You must replace either the handles or blade when the blade and handles start to slap.

There are some pinless designs that replace the contact point on the handles with a replacable part. By construction, it is still pinless as the part is not a pin, but it detracts from the hardware-less essence of a pinless design, as an intermediate part exists now, a proprietary part even harder to replace than a simple metal pin.
