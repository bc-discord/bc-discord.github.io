# Stop System Maintenance

Your <ins>stop system</ins> prevents the handles and blade from slapping into each other; typically small, metal dowels are put into either the blade or handles to accomplish this.

---

## Zen Zins
When the stop pins lie in the handles, that is a <ins>zen pin</ins> system.

The HRC of the zen pins should match with the blade's so they last long. There are 3 variants of them:
- Pressed: When the pins are <ins>pressed</ins> into the handles with tooling. 
  - **Maintenance**: Requires an extra set of zen pins to replace and an arbor press. You will most likely pay the maker to replace the pins.
- Screwed: When the pins are <ins>screws</ins> that go into one/two-sided sexbolts (possibly with a lip). 
  - **Maintenance**: Will require [threadlocking]({% link pages/balisong/maintenance/threadlocker.md %}) to stay in place. Most of the time these are easy to acquire.
- Hidden: When the top of the pins are <ins>hidden</ins> from the top of the handles, easily by sandwich/chandwich construction or cleverly alongside channel construction (link Zentinel). 
  - **Maintenance**: These are the easiest to service as they only require screw-less hardware, typically metal pins.

## Tang Pins

When the stop pins lie in the blade, that is a <ins>tang pin</ins> system. 

{% include image_strip.html urls="tang_pins.jpg" description="Example of pressed tang pins on a Jimpy Sentinel." %}

This system outperforms zen pins on longevity (on a single charge) when the pins match the HRC of the handles; soft-on-soft interaction wears down the least material compared to hard-on-hard interaction. Two variants exist for tang pins:

- Pressed: When the pins are <ins>pressed</ins> into the blade. 
  - **Maintenance**: You must have replacement pins and an arbor press. Typically, you will pay the maker to replace them.
- Screwed: The least desired variant, when the tang pins are <ins>screwed</ins> in place. 
  - **Maintenance**: [Threadlocking]({% link pages/balisong/maintenance/threadlocker.md %}) is required. You will most likely buy these from the maker.

## Pinless

When the handles and blade are designed to contact on the blade tang without pins, it is called a <ins>pinless</ins> system. 

- **Maintenance**: There is typically no intermediate-part maintenance. But be wary as the blade contacting the handles will wear them down by the mismatch of HRC. You must replace either the handles or blade when your balisong starts to slap.

There are some pinless designs that replace the contact point on the handles with a replacable part. By construction, it is still pinless as the part is not a pin, but it detracts from the hardware-less essence of a pinless design, as an intermediate part exists now, a proprietary part even harder to replace than a simple metal pin.
