# Pivot System Maintenance

To stop the handles from directly rubbing against the blade when constructed, a <ins>pivot system</ins> is required. Visit the [lubricant]({% link pages/balisong/maintenance/lubricants.md %}) page for a list of lubricants to use for your pivot system.

## Washers only

Washers are thin, circular, small pieces of metal with a hole that sits between the handles and blade, going around the sexbolt. The typical and safe material to use is phosphorous bronze (PB) washers.

**Be careful** with these metal washers:

- Titanium washers: Wear-and-tear will fuse the washers into titanium handles.
- Steel washers: Steel washers do hold their tune much longer than PB washers, but under-lubrication causes the washers to eat into the blade.

### Tuning
Tuning a washers-only balisong is simple.

1. Apply threadlocking.
2. Crank the screws right before the balisong motion seizes. 

{: .important }
> One side of the washer typically has smoothed edges and a smoother surface; that side should be facing the washers. If one side is not smoother, the side that faces the blade does not matter, but be consistent.

## Bushings

<ins>Bushings</ins> are metal cylinders that sit within the blade pivot blades and are sandwich between the washers then the handles. Bushings maintain a tight tune by keeping a fixed distance between the washer and the blade.

The bushing itself maintains tolerances for a long ass time; you don't need to swap these out unless the initial tune is bad. The only thing you need to do is

- lubricate the pivots
- swap out the washers when tolerances are not satisfactory

There is another bushing setup called <ins>floating washers</ins> where the bushings directly contact the handles while the washers go around the bushing. This system has been abandoned because it's harder to execute without binding and the steel bushings eat into the handle material.

### Tuning

Your bushings are considered <ins>undersized</ins> if a full crank of your screws causes the motion of your balisong to seize, to any degree. To fix this, you need to tune a new set of bushings with the correct thickness. 

{: .important }
> You are better off sending it back to the maker for a retune if tolerances are not up to standard; most makers will charge you for a bushing retune if you tamper with the bushings. Undersized bushings are considered a manufacturering defect; most will retune free-of-charge.

To tune your bushings, you need 
- a flat surface
- some sandpaper

1. Lay some sandpaper onto the flat surface.
2. Pick one side of the bushing to work on. **Be consistent**.
3. Lay the bushing onto the sandpaper and move in a circle to remove material.  
    - **Do not press down hard**; if your hand or bushing is slipping off the sandpaper, press softer.
4. Constantly check your tune if you have removed too much material by assembling your balisong. 
    - When assembling, you must torque the pivot screws as hard as you can; do the same for screwed zen pins (be careful not to break the head off). You must use fresh washers everytime as the bushings will crimp the washers a different way on every assemble.

This is a barebones description of tuning your bushings. If you want consistent and accurate bushing tunes, get 
- several sheets of sandpaper at different grit levels (e.g., 200, 500, and 1000); as you get closer to blade thickness, increase the grit level for some breathing room
- a measurement tool (e.g., micrometer) to dial in the exact thickness and to save on washers when reassembling
- a [bushing lap](https://usaknifemaker.com/pivot-lap-basic-knifedogs-5-bushing-model.html) or [bushing buddy](https://www.squidindustries.co/products/bushing-buddy) to sand your bushings parallel to your flat surface and perpendicular (thickness length is at a right angle to the width of circle)

There's a few tricks you can employ to get a tighter tune:
- replacing steel washers with PB washers; softer-metal washers will crimp more than steel ones
- replacing the pivot hardware with fine-pitch hardware; the denser threading gives a stronger clamping force
