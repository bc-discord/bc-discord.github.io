# Price Recommendations
These recommended balisongs have some of these qualities: 

- good value - good material and construction for the price; the most important factor for being on this list
- close to a neutral balance, well-tolerated balances by any flipper
- consistently made with good quality control
- purchasable directly from the maker or easy to find second-hand
- easy to find replacement hardware (easy to service)

These recommendations are geared for the U.S. market; outside of the U.S., it's tough to recommended a balisong since the U.S. has the most buyers and makers in the community. All prices are in retail USD; you can expect these to be cheaper second-hand.

## Live Blades
---
### < $50

### $51 - $100
- **LDY**: Orion V1.5 · $85 · Available · ✦✦✦✦✧
    - Not a good beater because of Al sandwich construction.

### $101 - $200
- **LDY**: Sirius V4.5 · $125 · Available · ✦✦✦✦✦
    - Al channel handles. Good value for the handle construction.

### $201 - $350
- **Squid Industries**: Kraken · $265 · Available · ✦✦✦✦✦
    - Al channel handles. Consistent flipper, commonly used during live competitions.
- **FLS Balisong**: Liminal · $275 · Discontinued · ✦✦✧✧✧
    - Early issues with cracked tang; if you don't beat your balisong, pretty good value with Ti channel handles. Might be hard to find secondhand, but you can find these stupid cheap for 100 something secondhand. Bottom weights are not easily replacable. 

### $351 - $600
- **MachineWise**: SlifT V2 · $365 · Available · ✦✦✦✦✦
    - Titanium channel handles on bushings. Pretty good value. There's plenty of these floating around. If you want something more handle bias, find the V1.

### $601 - $800
- **MachineWise**: Serif · $650 · Available · ✦✦✦✦✦
- **Squid Industries**: Tsunami · $750 · Available · ✦✦✦✦✦

### $801+
This is where quality levels off. At this juncture, you're buying into variety of designs and craftsmanship (midtech/handmade).

## Trainers
---
### < $50
- **Nabalis**: Impulse · $45 · Available · ✦✦✦✦✧
    - Pins fall out, like most cheaper Nabalis balisongs.

### $51 - $100

### $101 - $200
- **Machinewise**: Prysma v1/v2/Pro · $130/150/180 · Discontinued · ✦✦✦✦✦
    - Best value is the v1 with 6061 Al handles. Upgrade to the Pro for rounded handles with 7075 Al.
- **Thomas Balisong**: Baikal · $150 · Available · ✦✦✦✦✦
    - A more modern recommendation. Al channel handles on bushings.

### $201 - $300
- **Squid Industries**: Nautilus V2 · $216 · Available · ✦✦✦✧✧
    - Pretty handle bias but favored for tech flipping. Al channel with CF/G10 scales makes it a subpar beater.  

### $301 - $500
- **Squid Industries**: Tsunami Trainer · $475 · Available · ✦✦✦✦✧
    - More blade bias than live counterpart.

### $501+
