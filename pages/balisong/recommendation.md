# Price Recommendations
These recommended balisongs have some of these qualities: 

- all close to a neutral balance, well-tolerated balances by any flipper
- made by makers with consistently good build quality and design
- purchasable directly from the maker or easy to find second-hand
- easy to find replacement hardware
- good value - good material and construction for the price

These recommendations are geared for the U.S. market; outside of the U.S., it's tough to recommended a balisong since the U.S. has the most buyers and makers in the community. All prices are in retail USD; you can expect these to be cheaper second-hand.

    - Early issues with cracked tang; if you don't beat your balisong, pretty good value with Ti handles. Might be hard to find second-hand. Bottom weights are not easily replacable.
