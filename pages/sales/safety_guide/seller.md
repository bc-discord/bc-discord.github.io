# Anatomy of a Sale
## Shipping
### Logistics

USPS is the easiest shipping service to use in the States. They provide shipping material for Priority and more expensive shipping options. They offers 3 main types of shipping. 

 - Ground Advantage (formerly known as first class)
 -  Priority
 - Priority Express

From least expensive to most expensive, they increase by shipping speed; in practice, ground advantage is usually equal speed in priority. They are all equally reliable in safety, Express being slighty better because of guaranteed 1 or 2 day fulfillment.

Third-party shipping websites like [Pirateship](https://www.pirateship.com/) can offer lower costs on shipping. Pirateship in particular can greatly cut the cost of more expensive shipping services like Priority Express from USPS or Next Day Air from UPS.

It is good practice to drop off a package at the front desk or at the internal bin in the post office. If you choose to use an outside dropoff location, you take on the risk of the item being stolen.

FedEx and UPS are also acceptable options if USPS near you is not reliable.

### Packaging
For a box or envelope, at minimum you must tape any loose edges. Use the soft, flexible envelopes, not the paper ones; you must also roll it up. If you pack poorly, it is **100%** your fault and you must recompensate the buyer.

If you can't find packing material like bubble wrap, paper towels work well. You should be stuffing just enough so that the item does not slide around in the box or envelope.

### Insurance
If you use USPS, **do not** get the insurance they offer; the price of insurance is marked on the package and has lead to theft by USPS workers in the past. Shipsurance from Pirateship works well and hides the price from the shipping company. If you are the first time owner and have a receipt, you will be much more successful when claiming the insurance.

## International Concerns
### Proxy Shipping
If you are not capable of shipping internationally, you can find an international proxy to handle shipping for you. They essentially act as a middleman except the buyer must pay first before shipment begins. International proxies usually charge shipping cost and a fee.

### International Shipping

When using USPS for international needs, they will hand off the package to the local shipping company in that country. If the country has good local mailing services, USPS is fine. If not, UPS is a good option, UPS will handle the delivery throughout the entire process. DHS works exceptionally well for Asian and EU countries too, but have limited availability in the U.S.

Here's a table of known countries that are safe to ship a whole balisong to.

As a general rule of thumb, most of the EU is not safe to ship whole besides eastern EU countries. Most of Asia and Oceania is not safe.
