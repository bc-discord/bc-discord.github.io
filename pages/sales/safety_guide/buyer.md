## Window Shopping 
---
If you have no immediate plans to buy or negotiate for a balisong, it's fine to just scope out your options, just be transparent about it.

## Negotiating 
---
There aren't any hard rules during the negotation phase, just be friendly and honest about what you would like to pay. If you agree to a price, own it; it reflects poorly on you if you further talk down an agreed upon price.

Usually the listed prices include shipping.

If hardship comes up and you are not able to pay anymore, alert your seller so they can quickly repost their balisong.

If you are not aware of market price, consulting with avid resellers is a good option; most people are friendly, so don't mind to ask!

## The Balisong Itself
---
There are a few aspects to the condition of a balisong to be aware of before purchasing. 

- Dents: any depressions or nicks in the blade or handles. *Sometimes* these can be removed by a refinish from a modder.
- Light marks: A blemish on the finish of the part. Sometimes called snail trails. *Most of the time*, these can be removed by a modder.
- Bushing tune: Some makers and enthusiast owners are poor/lazy tuners. You may ask the seller to crank on the screws to get an assessment. But, because of variability with hand cranking, your seller may not able to confirm if their balisong is truly binding. How bouncy a balisong is may help determine if a has undersized bushings. If they seem flat and weak in a video, they are probably undersized. Bushings can be bought from [TrueLink](https://thetruelink.com/collections/all/bushing-xp) or [USAKnifemaker](https://usaknifemaker.com/shop-categories/folding-knife-parts/washers-and-bushings.html).
- Tolerances: Most sellers will not be able to acertain how well surfaced the blade or handles are (unless they have calipers/micrometers), usually you can infer by who made it and during what time period.

## The Scammer
---
Sometimes you'll run across sellers that seem shady and have little references. Here's a few things you can do to protect yourself.

- [ ] Request a video with a timestamp in view to check if they actually own the item.
- [ ] Ask for names of previous buyers to verify their selling history.
- [ ] Discuss relevant topics on balisongs, scammers tend to be unknowledgable on the hobby.

## Buyer-Seller Handoff
---
Typically, you the buyer must pay before the seller will ship a balisong. In cases where the seller has little or no reputation, you are afforded a couple of options.

- If you have sufficient credibility, the seller can ship first, then you can pay for it when it arrives to them. 
- You can acquire a reputable middleman which can act as an intermediary for the sale. Here is an outline of the process.
  
> 1. [Seller] ships the item to the [middleman].
> 2. [Middleman] verifies condition and contents of the item.
> 3. [Buyer] pays the [seller].
> 4. [Middleman] ships to the [buyer].

 Makers and modders make for good middlemans, be wary of individual reputation though.

 If a package has gone missing, it is upright for the seller to compensate you; but, **do not** count on them doing so. A reasonable ask is to go 50/50 on the cost of the item.

## Trading
---
In the case of trading, it is inherently riskier than buying since there are no feasible recourses to recoup lost value. It is highly advised to get a middleman to facilitate the trade. Without a middleman, you would ship at the same time as the other person. Sometimes you can recall a package if the trader seems to be delaying shipment.

## Payment
---
 If you are paying, most sellers take PayPal and other payment processors like Zelle, Cashapp, or Venmo. Wires are also an option, they aren't complicated to perform and can usually be done through your banking app; be aware of the fees that can incure with receiving one. To wire, your seller must give you the following information:

- their name
- bank name
- bank account number
- bank address

and whatever else your bank requires to send a wire. [Wise](https://wise.com/invite/ahpe/calvinn95) is a good alternative payment option which can also handle international currencies. You can also get a payment middleman to pay on your behalf.

## Aftercare
---
When a sale has completed, a seller may request you to affirm their credibility. On Instagram, you can leave a comment on their reference post if they have one. On Facebook, a seller may ask for a 'vouch' when dealing with a buyer. The balisong community is small, relative to other secondhand markets, be nice and help a human out.

## Conflict Resolution
---
If a person has scammed you out of a balisong, you can go public with the situation and provide message evidence to assert your case. You must **always** provide evidence of wrongdoing before making a claim, no exceptions. Facebook has a blacklist group you can request help from.

If a seller has misrepresented the condition of the balisong, it is preferable to handle the situation privately. Renegotiating price after the transaction has completed is messy, consult with friends and reliable people. It is only appropriate to go public if the damage is severe; be warned that going public with minor issues will result in pushback or general apathy from the community.
