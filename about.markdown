# About
---
This is a small wiki for the Balisong Community discord server. This website serves mostly text and a few images. 

## For Contributers
If you would like to contribute:

1. Request access from [the repository owner](balisongcommunity.discord@gmail.com) by emailing.
2. Head to the [repository](https://github.com/bc-discord/bc-discord.github.io).
3. Create a new branch based on `main`.
4. Make your edits.
5. Submit your pull request.
6. If your edits look fine, they will be accepted with your changes reflected in the website.

### Github Usage
Github is the place that stores code and information for the website, with some infrastructure to manage it. The project area is called a **repository**, which is [this page](https://github.com/bc-discord/bc-discord.github.io); the repository is made up of different **branches**, different copies of your code different people can manage. The `main` branch is the deployment branch the website is based on. To organize your changes, make your own branch, most likely from the `main` branch. Making a change requires a **commit** that represents the change. You can edit files directly in Github, then commit your changes; a **push** publishes your commit. You can commit several times for a given branch, with commits that pertain to different files. To merge your changes into the `main` branch, make a **pull request** that goes from `your branch â†’ main`. There are Github rules inplace that require reviews from other contributers for a pull request to be approved.
